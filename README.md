# ticTacToe_Apple_Watch
Tic-tac-toe on the Apple Watch to challenge friends and strangers off the street

Made it without much tutorials, felt good :) Swift progress hehe

The logic / game file, [ContentView.swift](https://github.com/mrvivacious/ticTacToe_Apple_Watch/blob/main/ticTacToe%20WatchKit%20Extension/ContentView.swift)

Feel free to suggest improvements to the code design and whatnot

Enjoy


### todo

Add a demo (video / gif) to the readme

Add feedback for when the game ends in win/draw

Add Tic Tac Toe label in top left of app so it looks more like an Apple in-house app

Add settings page where user can disable the lettering on the tile (x/o) to keep only the colors as game pieces

Publish this to the store, share on fb / product hunt (but this isnt a product?? is free) / reddit (swift, ios, learn programming, etc) / hacker news? idk

? Light theme? For daytime playability and aesthetics hhhhhhhh

? Refactor code? This would require me to learn more about Swift LOL not a bad deal
